This is an organization that is focused on promoting C++ libraries that are functional for the Nintendo Wii U ready to be used in Haxe.

This is all about the HxCompileU project, the Haxe project that thanks to tools like Reflaxe/C++ and DevkitPro's DevkitPPC tools, allows you to create homebrew for the Wii U using Haxe and only Haxe!
